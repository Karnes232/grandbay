                        <p>Once you graduate to Advanced Open Water Diver, you can dive deeper. Youâ€™ll be certified to 30 meters / 100 feet, giving you access to a wider variety of dive sites and marine life. There are many sea creatures that you can't see at shallower depths, and wrecks are often found deeper.</p>
