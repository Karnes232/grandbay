                        <p>Located just a half-mile off the coast of Dominicus in Bayah√≠be, the 73-meter (240 feet) long St. George ship was originally built in 1962 in Scotland, and was used to transport wheat and barley from Europe to the Caribbean. Today, the sunken ship is home to barracudas, moray eels, king mackerels, and groupers, among other species. Due to its depth of 40 meters (131 feet), it is recommended only for advanced divers. </p>

                            <p>The small fishing village of Bayahibe is located on the south coast of the Dominican Republic, a great place to visit any time of the year. Scuba diving in Bayahibe, is probably the best scuba diving on the whole Island. Diving in Bayahibe is generally easy. Most of the reefs just offshore and the protected side of Saona Island have little to no current.</p>
